## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AfreenInnovates/deep-learning
cd deep-learning

```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Navigate to the desired section
3. Open notebooks in order for structured learning
4. Run cells sequentially


## Key Features

### Training Utilities (`reusable_codes.py`)
A comprehensive collection of reusable functions for PyTorch training:

**Core Functions:**
- `train()`: Complete training loop with history tracking
- `plot_history()`: Visualize training/validation curves
- `visualize_predictions()`: Grid visualization of model predictions
- `vis_preds_side_by_side()`: Side-by-side actual vs predicted comparison
- `predict_image()`: Single image prediction from URL or local path

**Helper Functions:**
- `get_device()`: Automatic device detection (CUDA/CPU)
- `denormalize_batch()`: Image denormalization for visualization
- Multiprocessing safety for Jupyter/Colab environments

**Usage Example:**
```python
from reusable_codes import train, plot_history, visualize_predictions

# to train model
history = train(model, train_loader, test_loader, optimizer, loss_fn, epochs=5)

# visualize results
plot_history(history)
visualize_predictions(model, test_loader, class_names)
```

### Utility Scripts

#### clean_nb.py
A utility script to clean Jupyter notebooks by removing widget metadata:
```python
# removes widget metadata from all .ipynb files
# helps reduce file size and clean up notebooks
```
